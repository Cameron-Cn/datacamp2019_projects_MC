Python

int
string
float

Asterisk in the In [*] means that code is still running--meaning it has not exited function yet.


Lists work with square [val 1, val 2, val 3]
                          0       1      2
                          

for (item) in [container/list] do (something)

DICTIONARY

{key : value, key : value, key : value}   #Squiggly brackets
.keys()
.values()
.items()

Three different referrents to data.    .items() is inclusive of both .keys() and .values()


Note on Importing Libraries (np and pd). Loads into "kernel," (although I am unsure which sense this kernel exists in...what)
   
   import [library] as [alias]
   
   
   Mean, Median, Mode (measures of central tendancy)

       (name).loc[(name)['Column'] == (value)] 
       #the double = sign means "where it is" rather than acting as an alias assignment
       
       
       same with 
       (name).loc[(name)['Column' <= (value)] 
       #values less than (value) could also use of course >
       
      
   
       #df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)  
        #This will remove your duplicates from the ORIGINAL source. 
        #DO NOT RECOMMEND running.
